#### Calculator (2025)

This calculator is a custom-built graphical interface created using Processing that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and access special functions like square roots, squaring, π, and a memory recall ("ANS") feature. It uses a grid of interactive buttons—some shaped as ellipses, others as rounded rectangles—to input digits, operators, and commands. The calculator tracks left and right operands, dynamically updates the display, and handles operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes features like sign toggling, decimal input, and a clear button that resets either the current entry or the entire state. The design emphasizes visual feedback and user interaction, with hover effects and color-coded buttons for intuitive use.
